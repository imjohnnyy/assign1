            <h1>About this website</h1>
        </div>
        <h3><br>What special features have you done or attempted in creating the website?<br></h3>
        <p>I had incorportated Bootstrap - a popular open-source CSS framework into each of the pages on this
            website.<br>
            I found that the main advantages of using Bootstrap are that
            there are a ton of existing components that were available for use, and that it was easy to incoporate into
            my website.</p>
        <h3>Which part(s) did you have trouble with? <br></h3>
        <p>I had struggled for quite some time with the regular expressions
            that was required to match the Status Code and the Status based on the user inputs.
            <br>Thankfully, I was able to solve this problem through looking at
            Dr. Jian Yu's lecture 4 slide on AUT Canvas from Page 21 to Page 30.<br>
            I had also struggled on styling the webpages with CSS, for instance, I spent quite a bit of time styling the
            spaces between two anchor tags.
        </p>
        <h3>What would you like to do better next time? <br></h3>
        <p>I would like to spend even more time on styling the UI for it to look more appealing, and for this I would
            need to improve my CSS skills.</p>
        <h3>What you have learnt along the way? Did you use any references or resources during this
            project? If so, please include the sources. <br></h3>
        <p> I had developed my understanding on regular expressions. Dr Jian Yu's lecture 4 slides were very helpful on
            this regard.<br>

            Another resource that I had used was Bootstrap. They were used for designing the aesthetics of the webpages.
